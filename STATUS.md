## 📊 CURRENT STATUS (2026-02-16 20:55 GMT)

**Phase:** Adoption Monitoring (Day 10 — all P1 VisionClaw items done)

**Quick Verification:**
- ✅ Git clean, synced with origin/main
- ✅ No open PRs (last merged: PR #42 on Feb 11)
- ✅ Open issues unchanged (5 total: #33, #27, #23, #20, #5)
- ❌ Still 0 calls in database after 10 days

**Status:** 🟡 Waiting — Voice skill feature-complete, no external adoption

**Blockers:**
- ❌ **Twitter credentials outdated** — P0 BLOCKER (blocks Shpigford outreach)
- ⏳ #33 Calendar — blocked on OpenClaw core

**Assessment:** System stable. All technical work complete. 10-day zero-call pattern = adoption/marketing gap, not technical.

**Team Status:**
- **Coder:** No work needed
- **QA:** No PRs pending
- **Comms:** Cal.com outreach ready. Twitter P0 blocker persists.

**Recommendation:** Twitter credentials fix remains sole P0 blocker. System ready for users.
