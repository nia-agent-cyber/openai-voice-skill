## Current State: ✅ PR #32 QA COMPLETE — READY FOR MERGE

### Critical Issue
**Josh Pigford (@Shpigford) couldn't get the voice skill working reliably and switched to Vapi.**

**PR #32** passed QA review. Ready for Remi to merge.

### What's Live
- ✅ `ask_openclaw` tool — pipeline working but unreliable
- ✅ Outbound calls via HTTP POST to `https://api.niavoice.org/call`
- ✅ Session bridge (T3) — transcripts sync to OpenClaw sessions
- ✅ Streaming responses (PR #30 merged)
- ✅ Security: inbound disabled by default (PR #29)

### In Progress
- [x] **#31** → **PR #32** — P0 reliability fixes ✅ **QA PASSED**
- [ ] **#27** — Integration testing for streaming responses
- [ ] **T4** — Inbound Handler (phone → session creation)

### QA Results (2026-02-05)
| Check | Status |
|-------|--------|
| Syntax check (`py_compile`) | ✅ Pass |
| Test suite (29 tests) | ✅ Pass |
| Exponential backoff impl | ✅ Verified |
| Timeout reduction (30s→5s) | ✅ Verified |
| Call ID logging | ✅ Verified |
| Code quality | ✅ Clean |

**Review posted:** [PR #32 comment](https://github.com/nia-agent-cyber/openai-voice-skill/pull/32#issuecomment-3852366818)

## Next Steps (Priority Order)

### 🔴 P0 - This Week (Reliability)
1. **PR #32** — P0 reliability fixes (awaiting review)
   - [x] Add exponential backoff to WebSocket reconnection (500ms → 30s cap, 10 attempts)
   - [x] Reduce default timeout to 5s (was 30s — too slow for voice)
   - [x] Add call_id tracking in all error logs
   - [ ] Add basic call metrics (`/metrics` endpoint) — deferred to P1

2. **Manual testing** — Full call flow with tool use (after PR merge)
   - [ ] Outbound call with ask_openclaw
   - [ ] Multiple tool invocations in one call
   - [ ] Test timeout/failure scenarios

### P1 - This Month
3. **#27** — Integration testing for streaming
4. **T4** — Inbound call handler
5. Replace subprocess with HTTP API for lower latency
6. Add structured logging (JSON with call_id, latency)

### P2 - Later
7. **T6** — Security allowlist enforcement
8. **T7** — Full E2E deployment testing
9. Real-time transcript streaming (during call, not just after)

## How to Make Outbound Calls

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.niavoice.org/call \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"to": "+1234567890", "message": "Your message here"}'
```

Note: CLI `message send --channel voice` doesn't work yet (OpenClaw core limitation).

## Infrastructure

- **Webhook Server:** port 8080 (webhook-server.py) — DO NOT MODIFY
- **Plugin Server:** port 8081
- **Session Bridge:** port 8082 (session-bridge.ts)
- **Public URL:** https://api.niavoice.org (cloudflare tunnel)
- **Twilio Number:** +1 440 291 5517

### ⚠️ Bridge Port Conflict

If bridge issues occur:
```bash
pkill -f "openclaw-webhook-bridge.py"  # Kill old Python bridge
openclaw gateway restart                # Starts TS bridge
curl http://localhost:8082/health       # Verify
```

Canonical bridge: `session-bridge.ts` on port 8082

## Cleanup Pending

Old `nia-voice-call` plugin should be removed:
- `~/.openclaw/extensions/nia-voice-call/` — DELETE
- `plugins.entries.nia-voice-call` in openclaw.json — REMOVE
