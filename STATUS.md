## 📊 CURRENT STATUS (2026-02-19 09:25 GMT+2)

**Phase:** Adoption Monitoring (Day 13 — feature-complete, zero adoption)

**Quick Verification:**
- ✅ All 97 tests passing (0 warnings)
- ✅ No open PRs (last merged: PR #42 on Feb 11)
- ✅ Open issues unchanged (5 total: #33, #27, #23, #20, #5)
- ❌ Still 0 calls after 13 days

**Status:** 🔴 Stalled — No technical work remains. Adoption blocked by marketing gap.

**Code Cleanup Done (Feb 19):**
- Fixed ALL `datetime.utcnow()` deprecation warnings across codebase (call_metrics.py, call_recording.py, inbound_handler.py, metrics_server.py, tests)
- Added `requirements.txt` and `requirements-dev.txt` (missing dependency docs)
- Added `pyproject.toml` with pytest config (tests now scoped to `tests/` dir, no stray collection)
- Fixed `test_context.py` return-value warning (pytest expects None)
- Test suite: 97 passed, 0 warnings

**Blockers:**
- ❌ **Twitter credentials outdated** — P0 BLOCKER (blocks Shpigford outreach & Cal.com DMs)
- ⏳ #33 Calendar — blocked on OpenClaw core

**PM Assessment (Feb 17):**
Hourly status checks are not productive — state has been unchanged for days. The project needs exactly two things:
1. **Twitter credentials fixed** (human action: Remi/Nia)
2. **Outreach executed** (Comms agent, once Twitter unblocked)

No coder or QA work needed. PM will check back when state changes (blocker resolved or new direction from Remi).

**Team Status:**
- **Coder:** Idle — no work needed
- **QA:** Idle — no PRs pending
- **Comms:** Blocked on Twitter credentials

## 🎯 Next Steps (When Unblocked)

1. **Fix Twitter credentials** → Enables Shpigford outreach
2. **Execute Cal.com outreach** → docs/CALCOM_OUTREACH.md ready
3. **Monitor first external calls** → Validate reliability in production
4. **Iterate based on feedback** → Ready for rapid response
