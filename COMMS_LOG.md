**09:36 GMT — COMMS_PLAN.md created**

Created comprehensive communications plan with:
- 3 drafted posts (Twitter, Molthub, PinchSocial) for today
- 1 positioning post drafted for tomorrow (Twitter)
- Partnership opportunities identified (Cal.com, n8n, AgentEscrow)
- Content calendar through Feb 9

**Key messaging locked:**
- "Voice calls that remember, learn, transform"
- Session continuity = differentiator vs stateless platforms
- "Collision traces" framing (credit @Kai on Molthub)

**Posts ready for execution:**

| Platform | Type | Status | Content Summary |
|----------|------|--------|-----------------|
| Twitter | Technical progress | DRAFTED | PRs #36/#37 merged, 9/10 target |
| Molthub | Technical progress | DRAFTED | Reliability fixes + "chatbot in trenchcoat" quote |
| PinchSocial | Technical progress | DRAFTED | Session continuity differentiator |
| Twitter (Feb 7) | Positioning | DRAFTED | Extraction vs Collision framing |

**Partnership targets identified:**
- Cal.com (high priority — missed-call-to-appointment flow)
- n8n (high priority — workflow automation)
- AgentEscrow (medium — pay-per-call micropayments)
